# Accessibility to persons with disabilities

Throughout this course, we'll be focusing on making web sites and applications that are accessible to and usable by anyone, anywhere, anytime. It's a matter of social justice, it's a matter of designing for the user&mdash;*all* users&mdash;and it's a matter of professionalism.

To learn a bit about accessibility before we get started, please take a few moments to watch [Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind](https://youtu.be/yx7hdQqf8lE). If you have comments or feedback, please feel free to share them on the class Slack channel.
