# Engineering empathy

Here at EDA we are not creating web developers but developing people. We run a soft skills curriculum, which will be woven into your technical development that gives you the skills to communicate, lead, pair, and work well in a team. In the tech industry these skills are highly sought after&mdash;which is why we teach them.

What you will learn about most is yourself.

We deliver the material in a wide variety of creative and exciting ways. In Phase Zero it will mostly be through videos and reading material.

Previous students have reported the following benefits, among others:

- Increased empathy
- Better relationships with fellow students that extend to their lives outside of the course as well
- Increased self-confidence
- Increased self-awareness
- The ability to learn more quickly, take in more information, and grasp complex systems more easily
- Adaptability in any situation
- Comfort in dealing with conflict and with difficult conversations
- The ability to give, receive, and integrate feedback

Some of what we will be referencing is included in *Search Inside Yourself*, which you will be expected to read and utilize throughout Phase Zero, and, indeed, throughout the onsite course as well. You can find the E-book the Google Drive folder EDA has shared with you&mdash;it may be in "My Drive", or in "Shared with me" in Google Drive left nav bar.
