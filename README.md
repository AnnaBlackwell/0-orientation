## Best practices for success

The Phase Zero material is organized into a series of nine "sprints", each approximately a week in length for the typical student. You can move faster or slower, but if you think 1 sprint = 1 week you'll have a good idea of your pace.



### Review the objectives for the sprint

1. Procedures for Phase Zero
	1. Review the objectives for the sprint (planning)
	2. Skim the material, getting an idea of what's there (scoping)
	3. Create a plan of attack (strategy)
	4. Work through the material, reading and doing and posting work (rigor)
	5. If stuck, move to a different subject and come back (adaptability, peristence)
	6. If still stuck, ask for help immediately (humility, open-mindedness)
	7. Take notes! (organization)
	8. Sprints are estimated at roughly a week: try to finish the material
	9. Return to past weeks occasionally and skim through your notes for review: redo anything that you've forgotten
