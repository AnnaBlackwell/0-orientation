# Atom

Atom is a text editor from GitHub. We'll be using it throughout Phase Zero. It's fairly new (so there are occasional bugs), but it's loaded with cool features.

To use atom, we'll first `cd` to our `workspace` directory, then we'll open Atom in that directory by typing `atom .` (remember: the `.` is the current directory) and hitting the Enter key.

That will open a blank page in Atom (if Atom opens with the settings tab open, just close the tab by clicking on the X on the tab). We'll create a new file called `index.html`. To do this, begin by right-clicking on the `workspace` folder in the left sidebar:

Now select "New File". When the new file field appears, enter `index.html` as the file name and hit Enter.

This will create a new file called `index.html` and will open it in the main window. Let's look at what information we have:
