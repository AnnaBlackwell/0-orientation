# The terminal

You'll be using the terminal regularly throughout your career as a developer.

Some people memorize a lot of commands for the terminal, and use terminal-based text applications (e.g., vim or emacs). If you invest enough time in such tools, you can become extremely fast. But it's a big up-front investment, kind of like learning a musical instrument.

Conversely, you can use the terminal sparingly and only when necessary, and then use graphical user interface (GUI) applications for most of your work. Because time is limited in this course, we'll focus on the GUI applications and will make minimal use of the terminal. But feel free to practice in your spare time if you want to become a command line wizard.

There are a small set of commands you'll need to get started with the terminal.

## pwd

You can use the "print working directory" command, `pwd`, to see which directory you are currently working in. The terminal is always pointing to a particular directory (folder) in your filesystem. Often, you'll see an indication of this directory in the "prompt": the text immediately above and/or to the left of the line on which you type. The "prompt" (to prompt you to type) varies depending on how your terminal is set up, but it appears every time it's your turn to type. The simplest prompt is just `$`.

Here's an example of running `pwd` on the virtual machine you're currently downloading:
